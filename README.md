* StackOverflow-Search *

This is a REST Client for Searching the entire site of StackOverflow. 
The data is fetched using StackExchange API and a python-wrapper library Py-StackExchange is used.
It uses urllib for fetching responses from StackOverflow API.
The Site is Built using Django as backend and Django Templates along with Bootstrap elements as front end.
Both the StackOverflow server and the Client imposes throttling so that there are limited set of responses 
over a period of time for a single user.

You can search by Tag name or by fetch the stats of a user.
More filters will be added soon.
